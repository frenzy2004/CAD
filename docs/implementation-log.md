# PatchCAD Implementation Log

This is the shared memory for implementation branches. Add an entry whenever an approach succeeds, fails, or changes an architectural decision. Never paste credentials, authorization headers, provider payloads containing private data, or unredacted deployment logs.

## Baseline discoveries

### 2026-07-26 — Repository and local runtime

- Branch/commit: `agent/patchcad-design` at `4900d80`
- Attempt: Inspect the initial repository and available runtimes.
- Result: worked
- Evidence: The remote repository contains the approved design specification. Local versions are Node 24.18.0, npm 11.16.0, pnpm 11.9.0, GitHub CLI 2.96.0, and Python 3.14.6.
- Carry-forward rule: Pin Vercel to Node 22.x in `package.json`; require the committed lockfile and full verification gate to pass under the available local Node runtime.

### 2026-07-26 — Vercel CLI availability

- Branch/commit: planning branch
- Attempt: Run `vercel --version`.
- Result: failed
- Evidence: No global `vercel` executable is installed.
- Carry-forward rule: Use a pinned or current `npx vercel` invocation; do not assume a global install.

### 2026-07-26 — FreeCAD executable availability

- Branch/commit: planning branch
- Attempt: Locate `FreeCAD`, `freecad`, or a command-line FreeCAD executable.
- Result: failed
- Evidence: No FreeCAD executable is present in the current environment.
- Carry-forward rule: Keep bridge contracts and I/O testable with standard Python. Report the real FreeCAD smoke test as unrun until an executable is available; never imply it passed.

### 2026-07-26 — Replicad Three.js helper package name

- Branch/commit: planning branch
- Attempt: Query `@replicad/threejs-helper`.
- Result: failed
- Evidence: npm returned `404 Not Found`.
- Carry-forward rule: The published package is unscoped `replicad-threejs-helper@0.23.0`.

### 2026-07-26 — Browser CAD kernel feasibility

- Branch/commit: planning branch
- Attempt: Verify exact browser-side B-rep editing and export using primary project sources.
- Result: worked
- Evidence: `replicad@0.23.1` supports OpenCascade-backed booleans, exact STEP import/export, tessellation with face groups, and a Web Worker architecture. `replicad-opencascadejs@0.23.0` contains `src/replicad_single.wasm`.
- Carry-forward rule: Keep the B-rep authoritative inside one single-threaded worker; use Three.js only for display and raycasting. Copy the pinned WASM artifact to a versioned public URL before builds.

### 2026-07-26 — Imported STEP scope

- Branch/commit: planning branch
- Attempt: Define a truthful first edit for arbitrary STEP input.
- Result: partial
- Evidence: A STEP file provides exact topology but usually lacks editable parametric feature history. A planar-face cylinder cut is deterministic; generic existing-hole resize requires recognition, removal, healing, and recreation.
- Carry-forward rule: Browser import supports one solid and session-owned add/resize hole features. Refuse arbitrary pre-existing-hole resize. The included parametric bracket can safely resize its known holes.

### 2026-07-26 — OpenAI plan contract

- Branch/commit: planning branch
- Attempt: Verify the current official structured-output interface.
- Result: worked
- Evidence: Official OpenAI documentation recommends the Responses API with `responses.parse`, `zodTextFormat`, and `gpt-5.6` for new projects.
- Carry-forward rule: Return only strict `PatchPlanSchema` objects, handle refusals and incomplete responses explicitly, then pass the parsed plan through deterministic geometry validation.

### 2026-07-26 — Secret availability and handling

- Branch/commit: planning branch
- Attempt: Check whether provider credentials or a Vercel token are already present in the process environment without reading values.
- Result: partial
- Evidence: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`, and `VERCEL_TOKEN` are unset in the current shell.
- Carry-forward rule: Never reproduce user-supplied credentials in a tool argument, file, log, or command. Use secure interactive Vercel input if available; otherwise deploy the honest offline CAD path and report the exact server-only variable names still requiring secure configuration.
